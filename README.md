## 🎶 About Me
I blend **music, code, and intelligence** to create expressive systems for mixing, mastering, and automation.  
As the creator of **Code DJ**, I build tools that connect Logic Pro X, Python, and MIDI to craft a new way of performing and producing music — where **code becomes rhythm**.

Alongside my creative work, I also support companies and studios with **administration and accounting automation**, bringing structure, precision, and efficiency into daily operations.
